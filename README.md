# phase-of-matter-by-machine-learning 
This project introduces unsupervised machine learning in the study of phase of matter in physics.
## Symmetry broken phases 
- Potts models(clock models) in square lattice. n=2 corresponds to Ising model.
- Monto Carlo method is used to simulate spin configurations at different temperatues. 
- High dimensional data of spin configurations are reduced by PCA method. 
- It is clear to see symmetric pattern after dimension reduction.
- Symmetry         
## KT phase transition   
In XY model, different phases are not marked by symmetry breaking

  - Traditional dimensional
